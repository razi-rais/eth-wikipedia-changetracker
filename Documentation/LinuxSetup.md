## Mac OS X / Linux 

Running this project on both Mac OS X and Linux requires almost identical steps. We will predominantly be using Docker for almost all projects, so packaging requirements are minimial and Docker images should work as-is on Linux/Mac OS X.    

First make sure you have following prerequisites installed:

* Docker 17.2.0-ce (or later version)
* Geth 1.7.3 (later versions may also be fine, but code has not been tested on them)
* Node 9.5.0 
* NPM 5.6.0  
* Git 2.15.1 (or later version)
