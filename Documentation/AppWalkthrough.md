# App Walkthrough
This is a simple walkthrough of the working app for demonstration purposes.  The instructions will include technical aspects such as how things are working in the background with the Wikipedia API or how data is being saved.

The purpose of the application is to save Wikipedia URLs that you want to track the changes for, all in one place.  For example, if you are a music producer you may want to track all the albums' and artists' pages that you produce so that you know what changes the public makes to those Wikipedia pages.  Or, you could be a scientist keeping track of certain pages in your niche and you want to see if new research is added to your pages.  

Please see the [setup page](https://github.com/razi-rais/eth-wikipedia-changetracker/blob/master/Documentation/Setup.md) if you would like to learn how to setup this application on your machine. 

1. When you first open the app, if you are logged in, you will see a Dashboard page with any Wikipedia articles you have saved.  This will be empty if you have not saved any. 
2. If you click on the Watch button, you can choose to add a Wikipedia URL.  For example, try to add the following URL: 
3. Now go back to the Dashboard page
