# Setup Introduction
Setup instructions will be broken down by different environments.  The project was built in Python so it would be more cross platform. If you would like to use a VM to ensure everything is in a clean environment, we have an Azure ARM template that you can deploy with easily just by clicking below.  Otherwise, you are welcome to use your local machines.  You do not need to use Visual Studio (Community Edition works) or Visual Studio Code if you have another IDE in mind.   

# Start Here and choose Your OS: 
We have separate instructions for Windows and Mac.  Windows will have setup instructions for a local Windows machine and for how to setup a Windows Server 2016 VM on Azure.  Mac instructions are also provided, and Linux will be similar to the Mac setup. 

* [Windows / Visual Studio Setup](https://github.com/razi-rais/eth-wikipedia-changetracker/blob/master/Documentation/Windows.md) - Choose this if you are a Windows user and want to set this up using your local machine. 
* [Mac Setup (Linux will be similar)](https://github.com/razi-rais/eth-wikipedia-changetracker/blob/master/Documentation/LinuxSetup.md) - Choose this if you are a Mac user and want to set this up using your local machine.
